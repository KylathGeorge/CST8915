### Reflection Questions

1. What changes did you make to the order-service and product-service to comply with the Configurations and Backing Services factors of the 12-Factor App methodology?
Answer:
2. Why is it important to use environment variables instead of hard-coding configurations in your application?
Answer:
3. Why is it important to have separate repositories for each microservice? How does this help maintain independence and scalability of each service?
Answer: This allows each microservice to be loosely coupled and allows each of them to be independent and have no or little knowledge of the other services. If one service goes down due to a bug or other reasons, the other services will not be affected. This also allows for new services to be added without affecting other services.
