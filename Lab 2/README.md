### Reflection Questions

1. What changes did you make to the order-service and product-service to comply with the Configurations and Backing Services factors of the 12-Factor App methodology?
2. Why is it important to use environment variables instead of hard-coding configurations in your application?
3. Why is it important to have separate repositories for each microservice? How does this help maintain independence and scalability of each service?
